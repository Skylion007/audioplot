= What kind of data file can I upload? =

Basically, a data file contains 2 rows of numbers x/y, separated by spaces or tab characters, _e.g._

{{{
0	1
1	0.999200106660978
2	0.996801706302619
3	0.992808635853866
...
}}}

== Can I add header line to name the columns? ==

By default, the two columns are named _x_ and _y_, but if the first line is a text, then it will be parsed and considered as column names, _e.g_
{{{
time height
0	1
1	0.999200106660978
2	0.996801706302619
3	0.992808635853866
...
}}}

== Can I add comments? ==
Yep! all lines starting with a _#_ character will be considered as a comment. Comment line will be extracted and reported on the analysis page.
